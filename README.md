# selfcare.tech
a repository of self-care resources

one day i wasn't feeling well and told some friends on [We All JS](http://wealljs.org/) that i was going to hide in my virtual hoodie. it started me thinking about how important self care is, and how little we pay attention to it in the tech community.

so often i see my fellow developers ignoring their basic needs for rest and refreshment. i started this site to provide a central location to find links that will help us all take better care of ourselves.

not a developer or involved in tech? you still deserve to take time for self-care, too! you don't have to be in tech to contribute and use these links.

have a link to share? just [submit a pull request](https://github.com/jenniferlynparsons/selfcaretech/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
